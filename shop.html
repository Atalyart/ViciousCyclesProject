            <h2>How can I buy from Vicious Cycles?</h2>
            Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. 
            Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash,
            credit, or in-house loan approval.
            All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, 
            and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan, or a transfer of funds to a
            third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.
        </p>

            <h3>Trade shows</h3>

            We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real showroom can only be 
            found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life.
